This research delves into the realm of bone to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of activity detection through the integration of state-of-the-art techniques.YOLOv8-Pose, a powerful human pose extraction model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), designed for segmented mesh generation, is the backbone of our research.The motivation for this study stems from the recognition that accurate and efficient activity detection is of great significance in various domains, including surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. YOLOv8-pose, SAM, detailed human pose information by leveraging the power of ImageNet, segmented mesh representation And using feature vector extraction to make human life safer by monitoring human activity.To address the computational challenges associated with large datasets, a custom filter function is introduced. This function selectively filters out extraneous keypoints and mesh elements, allowing for a streamlined dataset that retains only the most relevant information for activity recognition. Subsequent research has emerged with the proposal of two distinct models: the key point and mesh based model (KM-model) and the convolutional neural network-based SRGB-model.The KM-model emphasizes key point analysis and image mesh, integrating transfer learning to enhance its predictive capabilities. On the other hand, SRGB-model works on segmented images obtained through SAM, using the power of convolutional neural networks for feature extraction. A comparative analysis with existing models including graph transformer networks highlights the superior performance of our proposed models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.As we progress, the paper outlines the methodology, the implementation of YOLOv8-pose and SAM, the development of custom filter functions, and details the construction of the KM-Model and SRGB-Model. The next sections present the results of our experiments, validate the effectiveness of our approach, and provide a comprehensive discussion of the implications and future directions of this research.In essence, this study intends to contribute to the growing landscape of HAR by introducing novel methods that not only increase the accuracy of activity recognition but also lay the foundation for real-time applications in various domains.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated work:'),\n",

The overarching objective of image segmentation resides in the transformation and simplification of an image's representation, rendering it more interpretable and amenable to detailed analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this intricate process, the outcome is a collection of segments, each comprising pixels that exhibit shared characteristics. These commonalities may manifest in various forms, encompassing attributes such as color, intensity, texture, or shape. The nuanced artistry of image segmentation lies in its capacity to distill complex visual information into meaningful components, paving the way for enhanced comprehension and analytical insights.\\n\\n\\n\\nSegment Anything Method:\\n\\n\\n\\nSemantic Annotation Model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for segmentation tasks, leveraging a vast dataset of 11 million images and over 1 billion masks. Comprising three primary modules—an image encoder, a prompt encoder, and a mask decoder—SAM exhibits impressive speed and quality in generating segmentation masks. However, this paper aims to delve into the nuances of SAM's capabilities and limitations, shedding light on its suitability for various annotation tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Generalization vs. Dataset-Specific Details:\\n\\nSAM's strength lies in its ability to perform well on average across a myriad of segmentation challenges. However, the paper posits that SAM may struggle with finer dataset-specific details, such as distinguishing the absence or presence of holes in certain object classes. The hypothesis suggests that dedicated, fine-tuned models might outperform SAM when nuanced annotations are crucial.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Handling Small Objects and Boundary Details:\\n\\nSAM's utilization of a standard Transformer architecture for image encoding presents a potential limitation in capturing small objects and boundary details. The projection of input images into a lower-resolution embedding space may result in the loss of refined details. Furthermore, SAM lacks dedicated refinement modules or zoom-in functionality during training, focusing on coverage and generalization rather than granularity.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Quality Limitations and Annotation Efficiency:\\n\\nWhile SAM excels in general segmentation tasks, the paper highlights a quality limitation that may impact its suitability for production deployment. ML-assisted solutions, including SAM, face challenges in significantly boosting annotation efficiency when near-pixel-perfect predictions are required. Manual editing may become more time-consuming than starting annotations from scratch for expert annotators, especially in scenarios demanding production-level accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.

Specifically, we employ two preeminent models: YOLOv8-pose and a pre-trained ImageNet model.\\n\\n\\n\\nYOLOv8-Pose:\\n\\nYOLOv8-Pose is a model that can estimate the location and orientation of human body parts in an image, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. It is based on YOLOv8, which is a fast and accurate object detection model that can recognize various objects in a scene. YOLOv8-Pose uses an anchor-free split Ultralytics head, which means that it does not rely on predefined anchor boxes to detect objects, but instead predicts the center points and sizes of the objects directly. It also splits the detection task into two branches: one for bounding boxes and one for keypoints. This way, it can handle different levels of complexity and granularity for the two tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOLOv8-Pose works by first passing the input image through a backbone network, which is a deep convolutional neural network that extracts high-level features from the image. The backbone network can be chosen from different architectures, such as CSPNet, ResNet, or EfficientNet, depending on the desired trade-off between speed and accuracy. The output of the backbone network is then fed into a neck network, which is another convolutional neural network that enhances the features and fuses them across different scales. The neck network can also be chosen from different architectures, such as PANet, FPN, or BiFPN. The output of the neck network is then passed to the head network, which is the anchor-free split Ultralytics head that predicts the bounding boxes and keypoints for each object in the image. The head network consists of two parallel branches: one for box regression and classification, and one for keypoint regression and classification. The box branch predicts the center point, width, height, and class of each object, while the keypoint branch predicts the location and visibility of each keypoint on the object. The final output of the model is a set of points that represent the keypoints on the human body parts in the image, along with the confidence scores for each point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOLOv8-Pose is trained on the COCO keypoints dataset, which is a large-scale dataset that contains images of people performing various activities, such as sports, dancing, or playing instruments.

The dataset also provides information about the visibility of each keypoint, such as whether it is occluded, out of view, or self-occluded. YOLOv8-Pose can learn to detect and estimate the keypoints on the human body parts from this dataset, and can generalize to other pose estimation tasks as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our feature extraction pipeline, we leverage a dedicated model designed for obtaining keypoints. The process unfolds in a systematic manner: initially, we identify all human boundary boxes within the given dataset. Subsequently, we discern and isolate the boxes where individuals are actively engaged in dynamic actions.\\n\\nThis discerning step acts as a filter, honing in on those specific instances that encapsulate human movement and activity. Once this refined subset is established, we seamlessly proceed to extract the relevant keypoints associated with these discerned boxes.\\n\\nThis meticulous approach ensures that our keypoints model is applied exclusively to instances characterized by human action, enhancing the precision and relevance of the extracted features.

The primary reason for scaling is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, especially when using models that are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Here are some key reasons why scaling is important:\\n\\n1. Equal Contribution of Features:\\n\\nMany machine learning models, such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks, are based on distance metrics. If features have different scales, the model might give more importance to features with larger scales, leading to biased results.\\n\\n2. Faster Convergence:\\n\\nAlgorithms that rely on optimization, such as gradient descent, converge faster when features are on a similar scale. This is particularly important for models with large parameter spaces.\\n\\n3. Numerical Stability:\\n\\nScaling can improve the numerical stability of some algorithms. Large values in features can cause numerical instability and make it difficult for the algorithm to converge.\\n\\n4. Regularization:\\n\\nRegularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, assume that all features have similar scales. Scaling helps maintain the balance between the regularization terms associated with different features.\\n\\n5. Certain Algorithms Require Scaling:\\n\\nSome algorithms, like k-means clustering or principal component analysis (PCA), are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Scaling is essential to ensure these algorithms work effectively.\\n\\nScaling is often performed using standardization or normalization:\\n\\nStandardization (Z-score normalization):\\n\\nThe Standard Scaler is a method used in statistics and machine learning to standardize the features of a dataset.

Decision trees and random forests, for example, are typically not sensitive to feature scales. However, many linear models, support vector machines, and neural networks benefit significantly from scaling.\\n\\n\\n\\nImage Rescaling:\\n\\nWhen working with images in deep learning, it is common to normalize the pixel values by dividing them by 255. This normalization is applied to scale the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. The reason behind this normalization is to ensure that the input data is within a consistent and manageable range, which can lead to better convergence during training and improved performance of the neural network. Here's why this normalization is often done:\\n\\n1. Gradient Descent Convergence:\\n\\n   - Many optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, converge faster when the input features are within a similar scale. Normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1] helps prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, which can occur when working with unnormalized data.\\n\\n2. Weight Initialization:\\n\\n   - Weight initialization strategies in neural networks often assume that input features are centered around zero and have a small variance. Normalizing pixel values to [0, 1] helps achieve this standardization.\\n\\n3. Activation Functions:\\n\\n   - Some activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh, are more effective when the input values are within a certain range. Normalizing pixel values to [0, 1] ensures that the inputs to these activation functions are in a suitable range.\\n\\n4. Numerical Stability:\\n\\n   - Normalizing pixel values helps maintain numerical stability during the training process. This is particularly important when dealing with deep networks and preventing issues like overflow or underflow during computations.\\n\\n5. Consistent Scale:\\n\\n   - Normalizing pixel values ensures that all input features (pixels in this case) are on a consistent scale. This can be crucial when training models with multiple input features or channels.\\n\\nIn practice, the normalization is often performed as follows:\\n\\n = \\n\\nThis operation scales the pixel values, which typically range from 0 to 255 in an 8-bit image, to the range [0, 1].

Instead of relying solely on two-dimensional representations (x, y), as commonly obtained from YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection, we incorporate a third dimension (z) derived from keypoints. This additional dimension adds depth to the analysis, enabling us to differentiate between individuals situated at varying distances from the camera.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rationale behind incorporating three-dimensional boxes lies in the inadequacy of solely relying on two-dimensional coordinates. For instance, assessing the proximity of two individuals based solely on their (x, y) coordinates may lead to inaccurate conclusions. Individuals positioned further behind may erroneously appear close to each other, potentially resulting in the misidentification of potential interactions.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo address this limitation, our custom box filter method systematically evaluates the three-dimensional spatial relationships between individuals. By considering the depth information provided by keypoints, we can accurately discern whether individuals are genuinely close to each other or merely share similar two-dimensional coordinates.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis innovative approach significantly reduces computational complexity, enhancing the efficiency of our model without compromising accuracy. By effectively filtering out individuals who are not in close proximity, our method optimizes the identification of potential interactions and contributes to the overall speed and precision of the model.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur research introduces a three-dimensional box filtering technique that leverages spatial relationships to identify and retain individuals likely to be involved in actions, thereby streamlining the processing of video frames and enhancing the overall performance of our model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKM-Model (KeyPoints Mesh Model):\\n\\nIn our sophisticated model architecture, we seamlessly integrate YOLOv8 Pose for accurately identifying human keypoints and establishing bounding boxes around individuals. Concurrently, we leverage the powerful Semantic Affinity Model (SAM) to segment our input image. The resulting segmented image and the output from the YOLOv8 Pose model are meticulously filtered through a custom-designed mesh and keypoints filter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis filtering mechanism efficiently identifies which bounding boxes are in close proximity to each other, facilitating a nuanced understanding of spatial relationships. Subsequently, the filtered mesh is subjected to an ImageNet model, extracting a comprehensive feature vector as expounded in Chapter 2.'),\n",

It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population exceeding 170 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. To the north, it is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation\\'s political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country. The official language is Bengali. Islam is the official and largest religion and Bengali Muslims form the largest ethnoreligious group in the country.'),\n",

Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule for next 200 years. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League, which was founded in Dhaka in 1906,[13] fought for a separate Bengali Muslim homeland in the Eastern Bengal, which was proposed in the Lahore Resolution in 1940 by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.\\n\\nIn 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup d\\'état, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The country came into existence on 16 December 1971 after the surrender of Pakistan, ending the 9-month long Liberation War.\\n\\nAfter the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader of the country. Mujib\\'s assassination in 1975 led to the rise of Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s was dominated by the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in 1990. After 1990, the \"Battle of the Begums\" between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next three decades. Following the overthrow of Hasina in a student–led mass uprising in August 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took power.\\n\\nBangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. It is a middle power with the second-largest economy in South Asia. Bangladesh is home to the third-largest Muslim-majority population and the fifth-most spoken native language. It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. It consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub districts, and includes the largest mangrove forest in the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largest refugee populations in the world and continues to face challenges such as corruption, political instability, overpopulation, and the effects of climate change. It has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum and hosts the headquarters of the BIMSTEC. Bangladesh is also a founding member of SAARC and a member of the OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations.\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names of Bengal\\nThe etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[14] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/yato/ML/Agentic-Chatbot/data/unstructured_docs/stories/bangladesh.txt'}, page_content='The term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[15] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[16] The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South Indian records.[17][18] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[19][20] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first \"Shah of Bangala\" in 1342.[19] The word Bangāl became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[21] 16th-century historian Abu\\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak mentions in his Ain-i-Akbari that the addition of the suffix \"al\" came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[22] This is also mentioned in Ghulam Husain Salim\\'s Riyaz-us-Salatin.[23]\\n\\nThe Indo-Aryan suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\". Hence, the name Bangladesh means \"Land of Bengal\" or \"Country of Bengal\".[18]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Bangladesh\\nThe history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region\\'s early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire. By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire. [24]\\n\\nFollowing the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, founded by Murshid Quli Khan in 1717. In 1757 the state led by Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey. The British abolished local rule in Bengal in 1793 following their victories at the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764), effectively taking complete control of the region; this event is considered the end of the Nawab\\'s power in Bengal and the start of direct British rule in Bengal. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution in Britain at the expense of flight of Bengal\\'s capital, and also faced significant deindustrialization. The Great Bengal famine of 1770 resulted in millions of deaths. The Bengal Presidency was established during British rule.[25]\\n\\nThe borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan during the Partition of India in August 1947, when the region became East Pakistan as part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan following the end of the British rule in the region.[26] The Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence on 26 March 1971 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, which culminated in the emergence of the independent People\\'s Republic of Bangladesh after victory was achieved on 16 December 1971.[26] Dhaka became the capital of independent Bangladesh.'),\n",

The country experienced one party socialism under Sheikh Mujib in 1975, followed by military coups and military rule, notably under General Ziaur Rahman and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. During the 1970s and the 1980s gradual economic liberalization and free market reforms were promoted, while Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. The country however experienced severe population boom despite its small land.[28][29][30] After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, the country saw power alternate between Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, an era dubbed the \"Battle of the Begums\"; which defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next 34 years.[31][32][33] For most of the 21st Century, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth, emerging as one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies, driven by its garment industry, remittances, and infrastructure development. However, it continues to grapple with political instability, human rights issues, and the impact of climate change. The return of the Awami League to power on 6 January 2009 under Sheikh Hasina\\'s leadership saw economic progress but criticisms of authoritarianism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in addressing regional issues, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.\\n\\nBangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing its poverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[34] to 44.2% in 1991,[35] all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[36] It has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[37][38] surpassing the per capita income levels of both India and Pakistan.[39][38] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh\\'s industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world in 2023.[40] In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh\\'s controversial general election. Following a mass uprising against the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to India.[41] An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Advisor.[42]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of Bangladesh\\n\\nPhysical map of Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[43] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\\n\\nThe Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\",[44] as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[45]'),\n",

Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[46] 12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country's haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[47] Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.\\n\\nIn Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[48][49]\\n\\nClimate\\nMain articles: Geography of Bangladesh § Climate, and Climate change in Bangladesh\\n\\nFlooding after the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, which killed around 140,000 people\\nStraddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905.[50] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year,[51] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.[52]\\n\\nIn September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[53] As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[54] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[55]\\n\\nClimate change\\nMain article: Climate change in Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[56][57] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[58] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[59] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[60] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[61][62]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain article: Fauna of Bangladesh\"),\n",

The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm.[64] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[65] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\\n\\nBangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: the South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin's Island is the only coral reef in the country.\\n\\nBangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[64] The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[66] The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[67] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[68] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[69] The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.[70]\\n\\nSeveral animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[71][72] Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[68] It ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[73] As of 2014, the country was set to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[73]\\n\\nGovernment and politics\\nMain articles: Government of Bangladesh and Politics of Bangladesh\"),\n",

Various ministers form the bulk of the executive organ, overseeing government departments and forming policies.[74] The Civil Service assists the ministers in implementing the policies.[74] All authorities unite to formulate policies, manage public services, and implement national development plans.[74] The President is the ceremonial head of state, whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law and maintaining the government's stability and continuity;[74] as well as fulfilling their duties as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces[77] and the chancellor of all universities.[78]\\nThe second pillar of the government is the legislative organ, also known as the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation).[79] Citizens across the country vote to elect the members of parliament (MPs).[74] The unicameral parliament has 350 MPs, including 300 elected on the first past the post system and 50 appointed to reserved seats for women's empowerment.[79][80] Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting against their party.[81] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker, who is second in line to the president as per the constitution.[82]\\nThe third pillar of the government is the judiciary branch, which is in charge of interpreting the law, resolving conflicts, and maintaining justice across the nation.[74] The Supreme Court is the highest court, separated into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division.[83][74] It is led by the Chief Justice with the assistance of other justices.[83] The judiciary has the power to assess a law's constitutionality and offer legal remedies. Protecting citizens' rights, making sure the law is applied fairly, and preserving the balance of power within the government are all made possible by the court.[74] The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported by Article 111 of the constitution.[84] The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.[85]\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative geography of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Divisions of Bangladesh, Districts of Bangladesh, and Upazilas of Bangladesh\\nA clickable map of Bangladesh exhibiting its divisions.\\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[86][47][87] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[88]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[88]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\"),\n",

For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.[121] The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[122][123]\\n\\nThe Bangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes a fleet of frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. The Bangladesh Air Force has a small fleet of multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh's military equipment comes from China.[124] In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders, counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security in northeast India.[125][126]\\n\\nBangladesh's strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[127] In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[128] The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on a Status of Forces Agreement, an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[129][130][131] In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[132]\\n\\nCivil society\\nMain article: List of non-governmental organisations in Bangladesh\\nSince the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions.[133] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee.

Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[139] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam.[140][141] The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[142] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.[143]\"),\n",

Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols.\\nBangladesh,[a] officially the People\\'s Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population exceeding 170 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. To the north, it is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation\\'s political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country. The official language is Bengali. Islam is the official and largest religion and Bengali Muslims form the largest ethnoreligious group in the country.\\n\\nBangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in 1947 as the eastern exclave of the Dominion of Pakistan. Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule for next 200 years. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League, which was founded in Dhaka in 1906,[13] fought for a separate Bengali Muslim homeland in the Eastern Bengal, which was proposed in the Lahore Resolution in 1940 by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.\\n\\nIn 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup d\\'état, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The country came into existence on 16 December 1971 after the surrender of Pakistan, ending the 9-month long Liberation War.\\n\\nAfter the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader of the country. Mujib\\'s assassination in 1975 led to the rise of Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s was dominated by the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in 1990. After 1990, the \"Battle of the Begums\" between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next three decades. Following the overthrow of Hasina in a student–led mass uprising in August 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took power.\\n\\nBangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. It is a middle power with the second-largest economy in South Asia. Bangladesh is home to the third-largest Muslim-majority population and the fifth-most spoken native language. It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. It consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub districts, and includes the largest mangrove forest in the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largest refugee populations in the world and continues to face challenges such as corruption, political instability, overpopulation, and the effects of climate change. It has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum and hosts the headquarters of the BIMSTEC. Bangladesh is also a founding member of SAARC and a member of the OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations.\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names of Bengal\\nThe etymology of Bangladesh (\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[14] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.\\n\\nThe term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[15] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[16] The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South Indian records.[17][18] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[19][20] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first \"Shah of Bangala\" in 1342.[19] The word Bangāl became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[21] 16th-century historian Abu\\'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak mentions in his Ain-i-Akbari that the addition of the suffix \"al\" came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[22] This is also mentioned in Ghulam Husain Salim\\'s Riyaz-us-Salatin.[23]\\n\\nThe Indo-Aryan suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\". Hence, the name Bangladesh means \"Land of Bengal\" or \"Country of Bengal\".[18]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Bangladesh\\nThe history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region\\'s early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire. By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire. [24]\\n\\nFollowing the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, founded by Murshid Quli Khan in 1717. In 1757 the state led by Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey. The British abolished local rule in Bengal in 1793 following their victories at the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764), effectively taking complete control of the region; this event is considered the end of the Nawab\\'s power in Bengal and the start of direct British rule in Bengal. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution in Britain at the expense of flight of Bengal\\'s capital, and also faced significant deindustrialization. The Great Bengal famine of 1770 resulted in millions of deaths. The Bengal Presidency was established during British rule.[25]\\n\\nThe borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan during the Partition of India in August 1947, when the region became East Pakistan as part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan following the end of the British rule in the region.[26] The Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence on 26 March 1971 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, which culminated in the emergence of the independent People\\'s Republic of Bangladesh after victory was achieved on 16 December 1971.[26] Dhaka became the capital of independent Bangladesh.\\n\\n\\nSiraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal\\nThe Constitution of Bangladesh, enacted in 1972, established a democratic state with fundamental rights, an independent judiciary, and an elected parliament called the Jatiya Sangsad.[27] Since gaining independence, Bangladesh has faced issues of political instability, economic reconstruction, and social transformation. The country experienced one party socialism under Sheikh Mujib in 1975, followed by military coups and military rule, notably under General Ziaur Rahman and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. During the 1970s and the 1980s gradual economic liberalization and free market reforms were promoted, while Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. The country however experienced severe population boom despite its small land.[28][29][30] After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, the country saw power alternate between Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, an era dubbed the \"Battle of the Begums\"; which defined Bangladesh\\'s politics and history for next 34 years.[31][32][33] For most of the 21st Century, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth, emerging as one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies, driven by its garment industry, remittances, and infrastructure development. However, it continues to grapple with political instability, human rights issues, and the impact of climate change. The return of the Awami League to power on 6 January 2009 under Sheikh Hasina\\'s leadership saw economic progress but criticisms of authoritarianism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in addressing regional issues, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.\\n\\nBangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing its poverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[34] to 44.2% in 1991,[35] all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[36] It has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[37][38] surpassing the per capita income levels of both India and Pakistan.[39][38] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh\\'s industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world in 2023.[40] In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh\\'s controversial general election. Following a mass uprising against the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to India.[41] An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Advisor.[42]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of Bangladesh\\n\\nPhysical map of Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[43] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.\\n\\nThe Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\",[44] as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[45]\\n\\nBangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[46] 12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country\\'s haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[47] Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.\\n\\nIn Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[48][49]\\n\\nClimate\\nMain articles: Geography of Bangladesh § Climate, and Climate change in Bangladesh\\n\\nFlooding after the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, which killed around 140,000 people\\nStraddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh\\'s climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905.[50] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country\\'s rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year,[51] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.[52]\\n\\nIn September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[53] As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[54] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[55]\\n\\nClimate change\\nMain article: Climate change in Bangladesh\\nBangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[56][57] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[58] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[59] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[60] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[61][62]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain article: Fauna of Bangladesh\\n\\nA Bengal tiger, the national animal, in the Sundarbans\\nBangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves.[63] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm.[64] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[65] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.\\n\\nBangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world\\'s largest mangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: the South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin\\'s Island is the only coral reef in the country.\\n\\nBangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[64] The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[66] The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[67] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[68] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[69] The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.[70]\\n\\nSeveral animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[71][72] Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[68] It ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[73] As of 2014, the country was set to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[73]\\n\\nGovernment and politics\\nMain articles: Government of Bangladesh and Politics of Bangladesh\\n\\nThe National Parliament building in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, a neighborhood named after the first Prime Minister of Bengal.\\n\\nBangabhaban (Translation: Bengal House) is the presidential palace of Bangladesh. It was originally a house for the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Bengal.\\nBangladesh, by constitution, is a unitary state[74] and a de jure representative democracy with a Westminster-style parliamentary system[75] that has universal suffrage.[76] The government can be divided into three pillars: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary—all function harmoniously to ensure accountability, transparency and checks and balances of the government.[74] Since its independence, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have remained two of the most powerful political parties in Bangladesh.[75]\\n\\nThe first pillar of the government is the executive organ, which is entrusted with the total administration of the country.[74] Executive powers are largely vested in the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, and oversees the cabinet.[74] The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. Various ministers form the bulk of the executive organ, overseeing government departments and forming policies.[74] The Civil Service assists the ministers in implementing the policies.[74] All authorities unite to formulate policies, manage public services, and implement national development plans.[74] The President is the ceremonial head of state, whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law and maintaining the government\\'s stability and continuity;[74] as well as fulfilling their duties as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces[77] and the chancellor of all universities.[78]\\nThe second pillar of the government is the legislative organ, also known as the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation).[79] Citizens across the country vote to elect the members of parliament (MPs).[74] The unicameral parliament has 350 MPs, including 300 elected on the first past the post system and 50 appointed to reserved seats for women\\'s empowerment.[79][80] Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting against their party.[81] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker, who is second in line to the president as per the constitution.[82]\\nThe third pillar of the government is the judiciary branch, which is in charge of interpreting the law, resolving conflicts, and maintaining justice across the nation.[74] The Supreme Court is the highest court, separated into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division.[83][74] It is led by the Chief Justice with the assistance of other justices.[83] The judiciary has the power to assess a law\\'s constitutionality and offer legal remedies. Protecting citizens\\' rights, making sure the law is applied fairly, and preserving the balance of power within the government are all made possible by the court.[74] The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported by Article 111 of the constitution.[84] The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.[85]\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative geography of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Divisions of Bangladesh, Districts of Bangladesh, and Upazilas of Bangladesh\\nA clickable map of Bangladesh exhibiting its divisions.\\nBangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[86][47][87] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[88]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[88]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.\\n\\nDivisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.\\n\\nThere are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.[89]\\n\\nAdministrative Divisions of Bangladesh\\nDivision\\tCapital\\tEstablished\\tArea (km2)\\n[90]\\t2021 Population\\n(projected)[91]\\tDensity\\n2021\\nBarisal Division\\tBarisal\\t1 January 1993\\t13,225\\t9,713,000\\t734\\nChittagong Division\\tChittagong\\t1 January 1829\\t33,909\\t34,747,000\\t1,025\\nDhaka Division\\tDhaka\\t1 January 1829\\t20,594\\t42,607,000\\t2,069\\nKhulna Division\\tKhulna\\t1 October 1960\\t22,284\\t18,217,000\\t817\\nMymensingh Division\\tMymensingh\\t14 September 2015\\t10,584\\t13,457,000\\t1,271\\nRajshahi Division\\tRajshahi\\t1 January 1829\\t18,153\\t21,607,000\\t1,190\\nRangpur Division\\tRangpur\\t25 January 2010\\t16,185\\t18,868,000\\t1,166\\nSylhet Division\\tSylhet\\t1 August 1995\\t12,635\\t12,463,000\\t986\\nForeign relations\\nMain article: Foreign relations of Bangladesh\\n\\nCountries that share diplomatic relations with Bangladesh\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden with Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City\\nBangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics.[92] It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific,[93] due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia.[94] Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974.[95][96] It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues.[97] Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent.[98] It joined the OIC in 1974,[99] and is a founding member of the Developing-8.[100] In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank.[101] Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.\\n\\nRelations with neighbouring Myanmar have been severely strained since 2016–2017, after over 700,000 Rohingya refugees illegally entered Bangladesh.[102] The parliament, government, and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of international criticism against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, and have demanded their right of return to Arakan.[103][104]\\n\\nBangladesh shares an important bilateral and economic relationship with its largest neighbour India,[105] which is often strained by water politics of the Ganges and the Teesta,[106][107][108] and the border killings of Bangladeshi civilians.[109][110] Post-independent Bangladesh has continued to have a problematic relationship with Pakistan, mainly due to its denial of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.[111] It maintains a warm relationship with China, which is its largest trading partner, and the largest arms supplier.[112] Japan is Bangladesh\\'s largest economic aid provider, and the two maintain a strategic and economic partnership.[113] Political relations with Middle Eastern countries are robust.[114] Bangladesh receives 59% of its remittances from the Middle East,[115] despite poor working conditions affecting over four million Bangladeshi workers.[116] Bangladesh plays a major role in global climate diplomacy as a leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.[117]\\n\\nMilitary\\nMain article: Bangladesh Armed Forces\\n\\nBangladesh Army personnel on a BTR-80.\\n\\nBangladesh Navy Frigate, BNS Bangabandhu.\\n\\nMig-29 and F-7, Fighter aircraft’s of Bangladesh Air Force.\\nThe Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.[118] In 2022, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 250,000,[119] excluding the Air Force and the Navy (24,000).[120] In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world\\'s largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.[121] The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[122][123]\\n\\nThe Bangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes a fleet of frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. The Bangladesh Air Force has a small fleet of multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh\\'s military equipment comes from China.[124] In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders, counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security in northeast India.[125][126]\\n\\nBangladesh\\'s strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[127] In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[128] The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on a Status of Forces Agreement, an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[129][130][131] In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[132]\\n\\nCivil society\\nMain article: List of non-governmental organisations in Bangladesh\\nSince the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers\\' associations, and trade unions.[133] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world\\'s largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[139] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam.[140][141] The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[142] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.[143]\\n\\nOn International Human Rights Day in December 2021, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions on commanders of the Rapid Action Battalion for extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights abuses.[144] Freedom House has criticised the government for human rights abuses, the crackdown on the opposition, mass media, and civil society through politicized enforcement.[145] Bangladesh is ranked \"partly free\" in Freedom House\\'s Freedom in the World report,[146] but its press freedom has deteriorated from \"free\" to \"not free\" in recent years due to increasing pressure from the government.[147] According to the British Economist Intelligence Unit, the country has a hybrid regime: the third of four rankings in its Democracy Index.[148] Bangladesh was ranked 96th among 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index.[149] According to National Human Rights Commission, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies.[150]\\n\\nLGBT rights are frowned upon among social conservatives.[151] Homosexuality is affected by Section 377 of the Penal Code of Bangladesh, which was originally enacted by the British colonial government.[152][153] The government only recognises the transgender and intersex community known as the Hijra.[154][155] According to the 2023 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 1.2 million people were enslaved in Bangladesh as of 2021, which is among the highest in the world.[156]\\n\\nCorruption\\nMain article: Corruption in Bangladesh\\nLike many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International\\'s 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index.[157] Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015,[158] followed by education,[159] police[160] and water supply.[161] The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and it was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for graft.[162][163][164]\\n\\nEconomy\\nMain article: Economy of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Tourism in Bangladesh and List of companies of Bangladesh\\n\\nMotijheel in the nation\\'s capital Dhaka is the largest commercial district in the city\\n\\nThe Padma Bridge, opened in 2022, is a road-rail bridge which spans the Padma River\\n\\nThe Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world\\nBangladesh\\'s lower-middle income mixed-market economy is among the fastest growing economies in the world.[165][166] A rapidly developing country, it has the world\\'s 36th-largest economy by nominal terms, and the 24th-largest by PPP.

Bangladesh\\'s large diaspora contributed roughly $27 billion in remittances in 2024.[170] The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency.\\n\\nAs of 2023, the large service sector accounts for about 51.5% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (34.6%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 11% of total GDP;[6] despite being the largest employment sector, providing roughly half of the total workforce.[171] Over 84% of the export earnings come from the textile industry.[172] Bangladesh is the second-leading garments exporter in the world, and plays a crucial role in the global fast fashion industry, exporting to various Western fashion brands.[173] It is also a major producer of jute,[174] rice,[175] fish,[176] tea,[177] and flowers.[178] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, electronics and leather goods.[179] China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh, accounting for 15% of the total trade, followed by India; which accounts for 8% of the total trade.[180]\\n\\nThe private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies.[181] Bangladesh\\'s economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include BEXIMCO, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals.[182] The Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges are the country\\'s twin capital markets.[183] Its telecommunications industry is one of the world\\'s fastest growing, with 188.78 million cellphone subscribers at the end of November 2024.[184] Political instability,[185] high inflation,[186] endemic corruption,[187] insufficient power supplies,[188] and slow implementation of reforms are major challenges to economic growth.[186]\\n\\nThe tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP.[189] Bangladesh\\'s international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million.[190] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Buddhist Vihara and the Sundarbans) and seven tentative-list sites.[191] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country\\'s total employment.[192] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year.[192] Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[193]\\n\\nEnergy\\nMain article: Electricity sector in Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Energy policy of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Power Development Board, Natural gas and petroleum in Bangladesh, and Petrobangla\\n\\nThe under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant at night\\n\\nWind turbines on Kutubdia Island\\nBangladesh, a country experiencing daily blackouts several times a day in 2009, achieved 100% electrification by 2022.[194][195] It is gradually transitioning to a green economy and has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people.[196] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country.[197] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertilizer.[198] The under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, under-construction with assistance from the Russian company Rosatom, will be the first operational nuclear power plant in the country. Its first unit, out of the two total units, is expected to go into operation in 2025.[199]\\n\\nBangladesh continues to have huge untapped reserves of natural gas, particularly in its maritime territory.[200][201] A lack of exploration and decreasing proven reserves have forced Bangladesh to import LNG from abroad.[202][203][204] Gas shortages were further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[205] Bangladesh stopped buying spot price LNG temporarily in July 2022, despite constant load-shedding, due to a steep price hike in the global market.[206] It restarted buying spot price LNG once again in February 2023 as prices eased.[207]\\n\\nWhile government-owned companies in Bangladesh generate nearly half of Bangladesh\\'s electricity, privately owned companies like the Summit Group and Orion Group are playing an increasingly important role in both generating electricity, and supplying machinery, reactors, and equipment.[208] Bangladesh increased electricity production from 5 gigawatts in 2009 to 25.5 gigawatts in 2022. It plans to produce 50 gigawatts by 2041. U.S. companies like Chevron and General Electric supply around 55% of Bangladesh\\'s domestic natural gas production and are among the largest investors in power projects. 80% of Bangladesh\\'s installed gas-fired power generation capacity comes from turbines manufactured in the United States.[209]\\n\\nDemographics\\nMain article: Demographics of Bangladesh\\nFurther information: Bengalis\\nPopulation (millions)\\nYear\\tPop.\\t±% p.a.\\n1960\\t51,828,660\\t—    \\n1971\\t70,276,758\\t+2.81%\\n1980\\t88,016,432\\t+2.53%\\n1990\\t111,633,717\\t+2.41%\\n2000\\t134,544,304\\t+1.88%\\n2010\\t152,201,981\\t+1.24%\\n2023\\t171,466,990\\t+0.92%\\nSource: World Bank[210]\\nAccording to the 2022 Census, Bangladesh has a population of 165.1 million,[7] and is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020.[211] Its total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 1.9 in 2022,[212] which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1.[213] The majority of Bangladeshis live in rural areas, with 40% of the population living in urban areas as of 2023.[214] It has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger,[215] and merely 6% aged 65 and above as of 2023.[216]\\n\\nBangladesh is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, as Bengalis form 99% of the population.[6] The Adivasi population includes the Chakmas, Marmas, Santhals, Mros, Tanchangyas, Bawms, Tripuris, Khasis, Khumis, Kukis, Garos, and Bisnupriya Manipuris. The Chittagong Hill Tracts region experienced unrest and an insurgency from 1975 to 1997 in an autonomy movement by its indigenous people. Although a peace accord was signed in 1997, the region remains militarised.[217] Urdu-speaking stranded Pakistanis were given citizenship by the Supreme Court in 2008.[218] Bangladesh also hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees since 2017, giving it one of the largest refugee populations in the world.[102]\\n\\nUrban centres\\nFurther information: List of cities and towns in Bangladesh\\nBangladesh\\'s capital Dhaka and the largest city and is overseen by two city corporations that manage between them the northern and southern parts of the city.

Bangladesh has a literacy rate of 74.7% per cent as of 2019: 77.4% for males and 71.9% for females.[234][235] The country\\'s educational system is three-tiered and heavily subsidised, with the government operating many schools at the primary, secondary and higher secondary levels and subsidising many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the Bangladeshi government funds over 45 state universities[236] through the University Grants Commission (UGC), created by Presidential Order 10 in 1973.[237] However, government expenditure in education remains among the lowest in the world, at only 1.8% of the total GDP.[238]\\n\\nThe education system is divided into five levels: primary (first to fifth grade), junior secondary (sixth to eighth grade), secondary (ninth and tenth grade), higher secondary (11th and 12th grade), and tertiary which is university level.[239] Primary level students have to pass the Primary Education Completion (PEC) exam to proceed to junior secondary. The junior secondary students then give the Junior School Certificate (JSC) exam to get enrolled in ninth grade, while tenth-grade students have to pass the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam to proceed to eleventh grade. Lastly, students have to pass the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam at grade twelve to apply for higher education or universities.[240][241]\\n\\nUniversities in Bangladesh are of three general types: public (government-owned and subsidised), private (privately owned universities) and international (operated and funded by international organisations).

Severe acute malnutrition affects 450,000 children, while nearly 2 million children have moderate acute malnutrition. For children under the age of five, 52% are affected by anaemia, 41% are stunted, 16% are wasted, and 36% are underweight.
