Swiss Airlines offers different fare types, each with their own specific\\ncancellation terms and conditions. The most flexible fare types such as Flex and Business Flex allow you to cancel your\\nflight up to 24 hours before departure without any penalty. For other fare types, cancellation fees may apply. If you cancel\\nyour Swiss Airlines flight outside of the 24-hour window, cancellation fees will be charged depending on your fare type\\nand the time of cancellation. For example, if you cancel a non-flexible economy class ticket, a cancellation fee will be\\ncharged. The closer you cancel to the departure date, the higher the cancellation fee. In some cases, Swiss Airlines may\\nallow you to make changes to your flight instead of cancelling it outright. However, these changes may also come with\\nfees or penalties depending on your fare type and the type of change requested. If Swiss Airlines cancels your flight, you\\nmay be entitled to a full refund or rebooking on another flight. However, if the cancellation is due to extraordinary\\ncircumstances such as bad weather or political unrest, Swiss Airlines may not be obligated to offer any compensation. In\\nsummary, Swiss Airlines' cancellation policy varies depending on your fare type and the time of cancellation. To avoid any\\nunnecessary fees or charges, it's important to familiarise yourself with the terms and conditions of your ticket and to\\ncontact Swiss Airlines as soon as possible if you need to make changes or cancel your flight.\")]"
