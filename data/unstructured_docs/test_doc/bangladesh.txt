Bangladesh,[a] officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population exceeding 170 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. To the north, it is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country. The official language is Bengali. Islam is the official and largest religion and Bengali Muslims form the largest ethnoreligious group in the country.

Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of British India in 1947 as the eastern exclave of the Dominion of Pakistan. Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule for next 200 years. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League, which was founded in Dhaka in 1906,[13] fought for a separate Bengali Muslim homeland in the Eastern Bengal, which was proposed in the Lahore Resolution in 1940 by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.

In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup d'état, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The country came into existence on 16 December 1971 after the surrender of Pakistan, ending the 9-month long Liberation War.

After the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader of the country. Mujib's assassination in 1975 led to the rise of Ziaur Rahman, who himself was assassinated in 1981. The 1980s was dominated by the presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was overthrown in a mass uprising in 1990. After 1990, the "Battle of the Begums" between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina defined Bangladesh's politics and history for next three decades. Following the overthrow of Hasina in a student–led mass uprising in August 2024, an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took power.

Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. It is a middle power with the second-largest economy in South Asia. Bangladesh is home to the third-largest Muslim-majority population and the fifth-most spoken native language. It maintains the third-largest military in South Asia and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. It consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub districts, and includes the largest mangrove forest in the world. However, Bangladesh has one of the largest refugee populations in the world and continues to face challenges such as corruption, political instability, overpopulation, and the effects of climate change. It has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum and hosts the headquarters of the BIMSTEC. Bangladesh is also a founding member of SAARC and a member of the OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations.

Etymology
Main article: Names of Bengal
The etymology of Bangladesh ("Bengali country") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore and Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam, used the term in 1905 and 1932 respectively.[14] Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.

The term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[15] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[16] The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangala Desa is found in 11th-century South Indian records.[17][18] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[19][20] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first "Shah of Bangala" in 1342.[19] The word Bangāl became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[21] 16th-century historian Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak mentions in his Ain-i-Akbari that the addition of the suffix "al" came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called "al".[22] This is also mentioned in Ghulam Husain Salim's Riyaz-us-Salatin.[23]

The Indo-Aryan suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means "land" or "country". Hence, the name Bangladesh means "Land of Bengal" or "Country of Bengal".[18]

History
Main article: History of Bangladesh
The history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region's early history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1204 and the activities of Sunni missionaries like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah established independent sultanate in Bengal, establishing the capital at Sonargaon and founded an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire. By the 18th century, Mughal Bengal emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire. [24]

Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, founded by Murshid Quli Khan in 1717. In 1757 the state led by Siraj-ud-Daulah was defeated by the British East India Company in the Battle of Plassey. The British abolished local rule in Bengal in 1793 following their victories at the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764), effectively taking complete control of the region; this event is considered the end of the Nawab's power in Bengal and the start of direct British rule in Bengal. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution in Britain at the expense of flight of Bengal's capital, and also faced significant deindustrialization. The Great Bengal famine of 1770 resulted in millions of deaths. The Bengal Presidency was established during British rule.[25]

The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan during the Partition of India in August 1947, when the region became East Pakistan as part of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan following the end of the British rule in the region.[26] The Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence on 26 March 1971 by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, which culminated in the emergence of the independent People's Republic of Bangladesh after victory was achieved on 16 December 1971.[26] Dhaka became the capital of independent Bangladesh.


Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal
The Constitution of Bangladesh, enacted in 1972, established a democratic state with fundamental rights, an independent judiciary, and an elected parliament called the Jatiya Sangsad.[27] Since gaining independence, Bangladesh has faced issues of political instability, economic reconstruction, and social transformation. The country experienced one party socialism under Sheikh Mujib in 1975, followed by military coups and military rule, notably under General Ziaur Rahman and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. During the 1970s and the 1980s gradual economic liberalization and free market reforms were promoted, while Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. The country however experienced severe population boom despite its small land.[28][29][30] After the restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1991, the country saw power alternate between Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, an era dubbed the "Battle of the Begums"; which defined Bangladesh's politics and history for next 34 years.[31][32][33] For most of the 21st Century, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth, emerging as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, driven by its garment industry, remittances, and infrastructure development. However, it continues to grapple with political instability, human rights issues, and the impact of climate change. The return of the Awami League to power on 6 January 2009 under Sheikh Hasina's leadership saw economic progress but criticisms of authoritarianism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in addressing regional issues, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, which has strained its resources and highlighted its humanitarian commitments.

Bangladesh has achieved remarkable feats in reducing its poverty rate, which has gone down from 80% in 1971,[34] to 44.2% in 1991,[35] all the way down to 18.7% in 2022.[36] It has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[37][38] surpassing the per capita income levels of both India and Pakistan.[39][38] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh's industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world in 2023.[40] In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh's controversial general election. Following a mass uprising against the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee to India.[41] An interim government was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Advisor.[42]

Geography
Main article: Geography of Bangladesh

Physical map of Bangladesh
Bangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[43] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.

The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or Pôdda), Brahmaputra (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the "Land of Rivers",[44] as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of India.[45]

Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[46] 12% of the country is covered by hill systems. The country's haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[47] Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.

In Bangladesh forest cover is around 14% of the total land area, equivalent to 1,883,400 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 1,920,330 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 1,725,330 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 158,070 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 33% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.[48][49]

Climate
Main articles: Geography of Bangladesh § Climate, and Climate change in Bangladesh

Flooding after the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, which killed around 140,000 people
Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3 February 1905.[50] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores occur almost every year,[51] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion. The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000 people.[52]

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[53] As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[54] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[55]

Climate change
Main article: Climate change in Bangladesh
Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[56][57] Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[58] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[59] It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[60] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[61][62]

Biodiversity
Main article: Fauna of Bangladesh

Bangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves.[63] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut, and date palm.[64] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[65] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.

Bangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries: the South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin's Island is the only coral reef in the country.

Bangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[64] The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[66] The Bengal tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[67] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon, Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[68] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer, jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[69] The country has numerous species of amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of birds.[70]

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[71][72] Although many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[68] It ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[73] As of 2014, the country was set to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[73]

Government and politics
Main articles: Government of Bangladesh and Politics of Bangladesh

The National Parliament building in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, a neighborhood named after the first Prime Minister of Bengal.

Bangabhaban (Translation: Bengal House) is the presidential palace of Bangladesh. It was originally a house for the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Bengal.
Bangladesh, by constitution, is a unitary state[74] and a de jure representative democracy with a Westminster-style parliamentary system[75] that has universal suffrage.[76] The government can be divided into three pillars: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary—all function harmoniously to ensure accountability, transparency and checks and balances of the government.[74] Since its independence, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have remained two of the most powerful political parties in Bangladesh.[75]

The first pillar of the government is the executive organ, which is entrusted with the total administration of the country.[74] Executive powers are largely vested in the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, and oversees the cabinet.[74] The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. Various ministers form the bulk of the executive organ, overseeing government departments and forming policies.[74] The Civil Service assists the ministers in implementing the policies.[74] All authorities unite to formulate policies, manage public services, and implement national development plans.[74] The President is the ceremonial head of state, whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law and maintaining the government's stability and continuity;[74] as well as fulfilling their duties as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces[77] and the chancellor of all universities.[78]
The second pillar of the government is the legislative organ, also known as the Jatiya Sangsad (House of the Nation).[79] Citizens across the country vote to elect the members of parliament (MPs).[74] The unicameral parliament has 350 MPs, including 300 elected on the first past the post system and 50 appointed to reserved seats for women's empowerment.[79][80] Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting against their party.[81] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker, who is second in line to the president as per the constitution.[82]
The third pillar of the government is the judiciary branch, which is in charge of interpreting the law, resolving conflicts, and maintaining justice across the nation.[74] The Supreme Court is the highest court, separated into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division.[83][74] It is led by the Chief Justice with the assistance of other justices.[83] The judiciary has the power to assess a law's constitutionality and offer legal remedies. Protecting citizens' rights, making sure the law is applied fairly, and preserving the balance of power within the government are all made possible by the court.[74] The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported by Article 111 of the constitution.[84] The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.[85]
Administrative divisions
Main article: Administrative geography of Bangladesh
Further information: Divisions of Bangladesh, Districts of Bangladesh, and Upazilas of Bangladesh
A clickable map of Bangladesh exhibiting its divisions.
Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[86][47][87] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[88]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[88]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.

Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.[89]

Countries that share diplomatic relations with Bangladesh

Bangladesh is considered a middle power in global politics.[92] It plays an important role in the geopolitical affairs of the Indo-Pacific,[93] due to its strategic location between South and Southeast Asia.[94] Bangladesh joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1972 and the United Nations in 1974.[95][96] It relies on multilateral diplomacy on issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, trade policy and non-traditional security issues.[97] Bangladesh pioneered the creation of SAARC, which has been the preeminent forum for regional diplomacy among the countries of the Indian subcontinent.[98] It joined the OIC in 1974,[99] and is a founding member of the Developing-8.[100] In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting regional trade and transport links with support from the World Bank.[101] Dhaka hosts the headquarters of BIMSTEC, an organisation that brings together countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal.

Relations with neighbouring Myanmar have been severely strained since 2016–2017, after over 700,000 Rohingya refugees illegally entered Bangladesh.[102] The parliament, government, and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of international criticism against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, and have demanded their right of return to Arakan.[103][104]

Bangladesh shares an important bilateral and economic relationship with its largest neighbour India,[105] which is often strained by water politics of the Ganges and the Teesta,[106][107][108] and the border killings of Bangladeshi civilians.[109][110] Post-independent Bangladesh has continued to have a problematic relationship with Pakistan, mainly due to its denial of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.[111] It maintains a warm relationship with China, which is its largest trading partner, and the largest arms supplier.[112] Japan is Bangladesh's largest economic aid provider, and the two maintain a strategic and economic partnership.[113] Political relations with Middle Eastern countries are robust.[114] Bangladesh receives 59% of its remittances from the Middle East,[115] despite poor working conditions affecting over four million Bangladeshi workers.[116] Bangladesh plays a major role in global climate diplomacy as a leader of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.[117]

Military

The Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.[118] In 2022, the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 250,000,[119] excluding the Air Force and the Navy (24,000).[120] In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.[121] The military budget of Bangladesh accounts for 1.3% of GDP, amounting to US$4.3 billion in 2021.[122][123]

The Bangladesh Navy, one of the largest in the Bay of Bengal, includes a fleet of frigates, submarines, corvettes, and other vessels. The Bangladesh Air Force has a small fleet of multi-role combat aircraft. Most of Bangladesh's military equipment comes from China.[124] In recent years, Bangladesh and India have increased joint military exercises, high-level visits of military leaders, counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing. Bangladesh is vital to ensuring stability and security in northeast India.[125][126]

Bangladesh's strategic importance in the eastern subcontinent hinges on its proximity to China, its frontier with Burma, the separation of mainland and northeast India, and its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal.[127] In 2002, Bangladesh and China signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement.[128] The United States has pursued negotiations with Bangladesh on a Status of Forces Agreement, an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement and a General Security of Military Information Agreement.[129][130][131] In 2019, Bangladesh ratified the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[132]

Civil society
Main article: List of non-governmental organisations in Bangladesh
Since the colonial period, Bangladesh has had a prominent civil society. There are various special interest groups, including non-governmental organisations, human rights organisations, professional associations, chambers of commerce, employers' associations, and trade unions.[133] The National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh was set up in 2007. Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee. The world's largest international NGO BRAC is based in Bangladesh. There have been concerns regarding the shrinking space for independent civil society in recent years.[134][135][136]

Human rights
Main article: Human rights in Bangladesh

The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) have been widely accused of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and human right abuses. The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned RAB in 2021.[137]
Torture is banned by the Constitution of Bangladesh,[138] but is rampantly used by Bangladesh's security forces. Bangladesh joined the Convention against Torture in 1998 and it enacted its first anti-torture law, the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention) Act, in 2013. The first conviction under this law was announced in 2020.[139] Amnesty International Prisoners of Conscience from Bangladesh have included Saber Hossain Chowdhury and Shahidul Alam.[140][141] The widely criticized Digital Security Act was repealed and replaced by the Cyber Security Act in 2023.[142] The repeal was welcomed by the International Press Institute.[143]

On International Human Rights Day in December 2021, the United States Department of the Treasury announced sanctions on commanders of the Rapid Action Battalion for extrajudicial killings, torture, and other human rights abuses.[144] Freedom House has criticised the government for human rights abuses, the crackdown on the opposition, mass media, and civil society through politicized enforcement.[145] Bangladesh is ranked "partly free" in Freedom House's Freedom in the World report,[146] but its press freedom has deteriorated from "free" to "not free" in recent years due to increasing pressure from the government.[147] According to the British Economist Intelligence Unit, the country has a hybrid regime: the third of four rankings in its Democracy Index.[148] Bangladesh was ranked 96th among 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index.[149] According to National Human Rights Commission, 70% of alleged human-rights violations are committed by law-enforcement agencies.[150]

LGBT rights are frowned upon among social conservatives.[151] Homosexuality is affected by Section 377 of the Penal Code of Bangladesh, which was originally enacted by the British colonial government.[152][153] The government only recognises the transgender and intersex community known as the Hijra.[154][155] According to the 2023 Global Slavery Index, an estimated 1.2 million people were enslaved in Bangladesh as of 2021, which is among the highest in the world.[156]

Corruption
Main article: Corruption in Bangladesh
Like many developing countries, institutional corruption is an issue of concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was ranked 146th among 180 countries on Transparency International's 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index.[157] Land administration was the sector with the most bribery in 2015,[158] followed by education,[159] police[160] and water supply.[161] The Anti Corruption Commission was formed in 2004, and it was active during the 2006–08 Bangladeshi political crisis, indicting many leading politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen for graft.[162][163][164]

Bangladesh's lower-middle income mixed-market economy is among the fastest growing economies in the world.[165][166] A rapidly developing country, it has the world's 36th-largest economy by nominal terms, and the 24th-largest by PPP. Bangladesh has a labor force of 71.4 million,[167] which is the world's seventh-largest; with an unemployment rate of 5.1% as of 2023.[168] Its foreign exchange reserves, although depleting,[169] remain the second-highest in South Asia, after India. Bangladesh's large diaspora contributed roughly $27 billion in remittances in 2024.[170] The Bangladeshi taka is the national currency.

As of 2023, the large service sector accounts for about 51.5% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (34.6%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 11% of total GDP;[6] despite being the largest employment sector, providing roughly half of the total workforce.[171] Over 84% of the export earnings come from the textile industry.[172] Bangladesh is the second-leading garments exporter in the world, and plays a crucial role in the global fast fashion industry, exporting to various Western fashion brands.[173] It is also a major producer of jute,[174] rice,[175] fish,[176] tea,[177] and flowers.[178] Other major industries include shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, steel, electronics and leather goods.[179] China is the largest trading partner of Bangladesh, accounting for 15% of the total trade, followed by India; which accounts for 8% of the total trade.[180]

The private sector accounts for 80% of GDP compared to the dwindling role of state-owned companies.[181] Bangladesh's economy is dominated by family-owned conglomerates and small and medium-sized businesses. Some of the largest publicly traded companies in Bangladesh include BEXIMCO, BRAC Bank, BSRM, GPH Ispat, Grameenphone, Summit Group, and Square Pharmaceuticals.[182] The Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges are the country's twin capital markets.[183] Its telecommunications industry is one of the world's fastest growing, with 188.78 million cellphone subscribers at the end of November 2024.[184] Political instability,[185] high inflation,[186] endemic corruption,[187] insufficient power supplies,[188] and slow implementation of reforms are major challenges to economic growth.[186]

The tourism industry is expanding, contributing some 3.02% of total GDP.[189] Bangladesh's international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $391 million.[190] The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Mosque City, the Buddhist Vihara and the Sundarbans) and seven tentative-list sites.[191] The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2019 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,180,500 jobs in 2018 or 1.9% of the country's total employment.[192] According to the same report, Bangladesh experiences around 125,000 international tourist arrivals per year.[192] Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012.[193]

Bangladesh, a country experiencing daily blackouts several times a day in 2009, achieved 100% electrification by 2022.[194][195] It is gradually transitioning to a green economy and has the largest off-grid solar power programme in the world, benefiting 20 million people.[196] An electric car called the Palki is being developed for production in the country.[197] Biogas is being used to produce organic fertilizer.[198] The under-construction Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, under-construction with assistance from the Russian company Rosatom, will be the first operational nuclear power plant in the country. Its first unit, out of the two total units, is expected to go into operation in 2025.[199]

Bangladesh continues to have huge untapped reserves of natural gas, particularly in its maritime territory.[200][201] A lack of exploration and decreasing proven reserves have forced Bangladesh to import LNG from abroad.[202][203][204] Gas shortages were further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[205] Bangladesh stopped buying spot price LNG temporarily in July 2022, despite constant load-shedding, due to a steep price hike in the global market.[206] It restarted buying spot price LNG once again in February 2023 as prices eased.[207]

While government-owned companies in Bangladesh generate nearly half of Bangladesh's electricity, privately owned companies like the Summit Group and Orion Group are playing an increasingly important role in both generating electricity, and supplying machinery, reactors, and equipment.[208] Bangladesh increased electricity production from 5 gigawatts in 2009 to 25.5 gigawatts in 2022. It plans to produce 50 gigawatts by 2041. U.S. companies like Chevron and General Electric supply around 55% of Bangladesh's domestic natural gas production and are among the largest investors in power projects. 80% of Bangladesh's installed gas-fired power generation capacity comes from turbines manufactured in the United States.[209]

According to the 2022 Census, Bangladesh has a population of 165.1 million,[7] and is the eighth-most-populous country in the world, the fifth-most populous country in Asia, and the most densely populated large country in the world, with a headline population density of 1,265 people/km2 as of 2020.[211] Its total fertility rate (TFR), once among the highest in the world, has experienced a dramatic decline, from 5.5 in 1985 to 3.7 in 1995, down to 1.9 in 2022,[212] which is below the sub-replacement fertility of 2.1.[213] The majority of Bangladeshis live in rural areas, with 40% of the population living in urban areas as of 2023.[214] It has a median age of roughly 28 years, with 26% of the total population aged 14 or younger,[215] and merely 6% aged 65 and above as of 2023.[216]

Bangladesh is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, as Bengalis form 99% of the population.[6] The Adivasi population includes the Chakmas, Marmas, Santhals, Mros, Tanchangyas, Bawms, Tripuris, Khasis, Khumis, Kukis, Garos, and Bisnupriya Manipuris. The Chittagong Hill Tracts region experienced unrest and an insurgency from 1975 to 1997 in an autonomy movement by its indigenous people. Although a peace accord was signed in 1997, the region remains militarised.[217] Urdu-speaking stranded Pakistanis were given citizenship by the Supreme Court in 2008.[218] Bangladesh also hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees since 2017, giving it one of the largest refugee populations in the world.[102]

Language
Main article: Languages of Bangladesh

The Shaheed Minar, a national monument in Dhaka established to commemorate the martyrs of the 1952 Bengali Language Movement, is a symbol of Bengali nationalism.
The official and predominant language of Bangladesh is Bengali, which is spoken by more than 99% of the population as their native language.[219][220] Bengali is described as a dialect continuum where there are various dialects spoken throughout the country. There is a diglossia in which much of the population can understand or speak in Standard Colloquial Bengali, and in their regional dialect or language.[221] These include Chittagonian which is spoken in the southeastern region of Chittagong,[222] Noakhali spoken in the southern district of Noakhali[223][224] and Sylheti spoken in the northeastern region of Sylhet.[220]

English plays an important role in Bangladesh's judicial and educational affairs, due to the country's history as part of the British Empire. It is widely spoken and commonly understood, and is taught as a compulsory subject in all schools, colleges and universities, while the English-medium educational system is widely attended.[225]

Tribal languages, although increasingly endangered, include the Chakma language, another native Eastern Indo-Aryan language, spoken by the Chakma people.[226] Others are Garo, Meitei, Kokborok and Rakhine. Among the Austroasiatic languages, the most spoken is the Santali language, native to the Santal people.[227]

The stranded Pakistanis and some sections of the Old Dhakaites often use Urdu as their native tongue. Still, the usage of the latter remains highly reproached.[228]

Islam the largest religion across the country, being followed by about 91.1% of the population.[5] The vast majority of Bangladeshi citizens are Bengali Muslims, adhering to Sunni Islam.[231] The country is the third-most populous Muslim-majority state in the world and has the fourth-largest overall Muslim population.[232]

Bengali Hindus form the country's second-largest religious minority and the third-largest Hindu community in the world. According to the 2022 census Hindus form 7.95% of the total population.[231][5] In the 2011 census, Hindus formed 8.54% of the population.

Buddhism is the third-most followed religion, adhered to by merely 0.6% of the population.[5] Bangladeshi Buddhists are concentrated among the tribal ethnic groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and by the Bengali Buddhist minority across coastal Chittagong, who mostly follow the Theravada school.[231]

Christianity is the fourth-largest religion at 0.3%, followed mainly by a small Bengali Christian minority.[5] 0.1% of the population practices other religions such as Animism or is irreligious.[231]

Education
Main article: Education in Bangladesh

The literacy rate of the districts of Bangladesh
The constitution states that all children shall receive free and compulsory education.[233] Education in Bangladesh is overseen by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education is responsible for implementing policy for primary education and state-funded schools at a local level. Primary and secondary education is compulsory, and is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools. Bangladesh has a literacy rate of 74.7% per cent as of 2019: 77.4% for males and 71.9% for females.[234][235] The country's educational system is three-tiered and heavily subsidised, with the government operating many schools at the primary, secondary and higher secondary levels and subsidising many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the Bangladeshi government funds over 45 state universities[236] through the University Grants Commission (UGC), created by Presidential Order 10 in 1973.[237] However, government expenditure in education remains among the lowest in the world, at only 1.8% of the total GDP.[238]

The education system is divided into five levels: primary (first to fifth grade), junior secondary (sixth to eighth grade), secondary (ninth and tenth grade), higher secondary (11th and 12th grade), and tertiary which is university level.[239] Primary level students have to pass the Primary Education Completion (PEC) exam to proceed to junior secondary. The junior secondary students then give the Junior School Certificate (JSC) exam to get enrolled in ninth grade, while tenth-grade students have to pass the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam to proceed to eleventh grade. Lastly, students have to pass the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam at grade twelve to apply for higher education or universities.[240][241]

Universities in Bangladesh are of three general types: public (government-owned and subsidised), private (privately owned universities) and international (operated and funded by international organisations). The country has 47 public,[236] 105 private[242] and two international universities. Bangladesh National University has the largest enrolment. The University of Dhaka, established in 1921, is the oldest public university. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) is a premiere university for engineering education. The University of Chittagong, established in 1966, has the largest campus.[243] Dhaka College, established in 1841, is the oldest institution for higher education.[244] Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) is the largest public university affiliated with the armed forces.[245] Medical education is provided by 39 government, 6 armed force and 68 private medical colleges. All medical colleges are affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Bangladesh, by the constitution, guarantees healthcare services as a fundamental right to all of its citizens.[246] The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the largest institutional healthcare provider in Bangladesh,[247] and contains two divisions: Health Service Division and Medical Education And Family Welfare Division.[248] However, healthcare facilities in Bangladesh are considered less than adequate, although they have improved as the economy has grown and poverty levels have decreased significantly.[247] Bangladesh faces a severe health workforce crisis, as formally trained providers make up a small percentage of the total health workforce.[249] Significant deficiencies in the treatment practices of village doctors persist, with widespread harmful and inappropriate drug prescribing.[250]

Bangladesh's poor healthcare system suffers from severe underfunding from the government.[247] As of 2021, some 2.36% of total GDP was attributed to healthcare,[251] and domestic general government spending on healthcare was 16.88% of the total budget,[252] while out-of-pocket expenditures made up the vast majority of the total budget, totalling roughly 73%.[253] Domestic private health expenditure was about 75.48% of the total healthcare expenditure.[254] There were only 5.3 doctors per 10,000 people, and about six physicians[255] and six nurses per 1,000 people,[256] while the number of hospital beds is 9 per 1,000.[257][258] The specialist surgical workforce was only 3 per 100,000 people,[259] and there were about 5 community health workers per 1,000 people.[260]

Roughly 60% of the population had access to drinking water in 2022.[261] In 2002, it was estimated that half of the drinking water was polluted with arsenic, exceeding levels of 10 micrograms per litre.[262] Bangladesh is crippled with one of the worst air qualities in the world, mostly concentrated in the densely populated urban areas, especially the capital Dhaka and its metropolitan area.[263] The World Bank estimated that roughly 80,000-90,000 deaths occurred in Bangladesh due to the drastic effects of air pollution in 2019. It was second-leading cause of death and disability, costing the country roughly 4-4.4% percent of its total GDP.[264]

As of 2022, the overall life expectancy in Bangladesh at birth was 74 years (72 years for males and 76 years for females).[265] It has a comparably high infant mortality rate (24 per 1,000 live births) and child mortality rate (29 per 1,000 live births).[266][267] As of 2020, maternal mortality remains high, clocking at 123 per 100,000 live births.[268] Bangladesh is a key source market for medical tourism for various countries, mainly India,[269] due to its citizens dissatisfaction and distrust over their own healthcare system.[270]

The main causes of death are coronary artery disease, stroke, and chronic respiratory disease; comprising 62% and 60% of all adult male and female deaths, respectively.[271] Malnutrition is a major and persistent problem in Bangladesh, mainly affecting the rural regions, more than half of the population suffers from it. Severe acute malnutrition affects 450,000 children, while nearly 2 million children have moderate acute malnutrition. For children under the age of five, 52% are affected by anaemia, 41% are stunted, 16% are wasted, and 36% are underweight. A quarter of women are underweight and around 15% have short stature, while over half also suffer from anaemia.[272] Bangladesh was ranked 84th out of the 127 countries listed in the 2024 Global Hunger Index.[273]

The festival coincides with Makar Sankranti celebrated in India and Nepal.[276]


Victory Day celebration at National Martyrs' Memorial
Among religious festivals, the two biggest festivals of the Muslim majority are Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the month of Ramadan—and Eid al-Adha, which is the festival of sacrifice.[277] Both Eids are celebrated with the longest streak of national holidays.[278] Other Muslim festivals include Mawlid (Eid-e-Milad Un Nabi),[279] Ashura on the tenth day of Muharram,[280] Chaand Raat,[281] and Shab-e-Barat.[282] The most celebrated Hindu festival is Durga Puja.[283] Other major Hindu festivals include Krishna Janmashtami and Ratha Yatra.[284][285] The biggest festival of the Buddhists across the country is Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha.[286] Among Christians, Christmas is the most widely celebrated.[287]

Patriotic national festivals include the Language Movement Day, which is celebrated on 21 February in remembrance of the martyrs of the 1952 Bengali language movement.[288] It was declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO in 1999.[289] Independence Day is celebrated on 26 March to commemorate the proclamation of independence from Pakistan.[290] Victory Day is celebrated on 16 December to celebrate the victory in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[290] Public gatherings are observed at the Shaheed Minar and National Martyrs' Memorial during the three latter festivals to pay homage to the fallen martyrs.[291][292]

Bengali literature forms an important part of Bengali culture. The Charyapada poems dating back to the 10th to 12th centuries are the oldest extant examples of the Bengali language.[294]: 40  During the Bengal Sultanate, medieval Bengali writers were influenced by Arabic and Persian literature.[295] Milestones of the medieval age include the Mangal-Kāvyas.[296] The Vaishnava Padavali movement was led by writers such as Vidyapati, Chandidas, Govindadas and Balarama Dasa. Shreekrishna Kirtana written by Chandidas marked a particular height of poetic achievement since the Charyapadas.[296] Other important works include Krittibas Ojha's translation of the Ramayana, Kashiram Das' translation of the Mahabharata, and Maladhar Basu's translation of the Bhagavata.[296] Writers such as Bipradas Pipilai,[297]: 349  Vijay Gupta,[298]: 104  Shah Muhammad Sagir, Zainuddin and Abdul Hakim were important figures.[296] Alaol, considered a bard, is a prolific poet of medieval period.[296]

The Bengal Renaissance from the late 18th century to the early 20th century had a profound effect on modern Bengali literature. Michael Madhusudan Dutt invented the blank verse in Bengali literature.[299] Mir Mosharraf Hossain was the first prominent Bengali Muslim writer.[300] Lalon, a fakir practising Sufism and sādhanā influenced the bauls.[301] Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote about the characteristics of the Bengali society.[302]

Rabindranath Tagore was the first Asian and non-European laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature.[303] Kazi Nazrul Islam was a revolutionary poet who espoused political rebellion against colonialism and fascism.[304] Jibanananda Das was the most recognized Bengali poet after Tagore and Nazrul.[305] Begum Rokeya is regarded as the pioneer feminist writer of Bangladesh.[306] Syed Mujtaba Ali is noted for his cosmopolitan views.[307] Jasimuddin was a renowned pastoral poet, popularly called Palli Kabi (folk poet).[308] Farrukh Ahmad is considered the poet of the "Islamic Renaissance".[309] Syed Waliullah was a notable novelist.[310]

Shamsur Rahman and Al Mahmud are considered two of the greatest Bangladeshi poets to have emerged in the late 20th century. Ahmed Sofa is regarded as the most important intellectual in the post-independence era.[311] Sufia Kamal was a major feminist writer.[312] Humayun Ahmed was the most popular author in post-Independence Bangladesh.[310] Shahidul Zahir was widely acclaimed for his usage of magical realism.[313] Other major writers include Akhteruzzaman Elias, Shawkat Osman and Syed Shamsul Haq.[310] Selina Hossain is a prolific female author in the modern era.[314] Muhammad Zafar Iqbal is a pioneer science fiction writer.[315] Anisul Hoque is a popular contemporary literary figure.[316] The annual Ekushey Book Fair and Dhaka Lit Fest, organised by the Bangla Academy, are among the largest literary festivals in South Asia.[317]

The architecture of Bangladesh is intertwined with that of the Bengal region and the broader Indian subcontinent. It is influenced by the country's culture, religion and history.[318] Hindu and Buddhist architectural remnants have been found in Mahasthangarh, which dates back to the 3rd century BCE.[319]: 157  Nandipada and Swastika symbols have been found on stone querns in the Wari-Bateshwar ruins, which indicate the presence of Hinduism in the area during the Iron Age—from 400 to 100 BCE.[320] The Somapura Mahavihara built under the rule of the Buddhist Pala Empire in the 8th century is an outstanding example of the pre-Islamic era.[321] Other Buddhist vihāras include Shalban Bihar in Mainamati and Bikrampur Vihara in Bikrampur.[319]: 164–167  Recent excavations have also uncovered new evidence of pre-Islamic smaller temples which served the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain populations of the area.[322] Indo-Islamic architecture can be seen from the 13th century, especially in the unique mosque architecture of the Bengal Sultanate, an example being the Sixty Dome Mosque among others in the Mosque City of Bagerhat—which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[323][322]

Mughal Bengal saw the spread of Mughal architecture in the region. Examples in Dhaka include the Bara Katra and Choto Katra in Old Dhaka, the Sat Gambuj Mosque in Mohammadpur and the Musa Khan Mosque in Curzon Hall.[324][325] Notable Mughal-era forts include the Lalbagh Fort in Old Dhaka, the Idrakpur Fort in Munshiganj—and the Hajiganj Fort and the Sonakanda Fort in Narayanganj, respectively.[326] The Kantajew Temple and Dhakeshwari Temple are excellent examples of late medieval Hindu temple architecture.[327][328]

Bengali vernacular architecture is noted for pioneering the bungalow.[329] Panam Nagar in Sonargaon exhibits architectural influence from the Sultanate, Mughal, British and hybrid colonial traditions.[330]: 22  Indo-Saracenic architecture flourished during the British Raj,[331] examples include the Curzon Hall of the University of Dhaka, the Chittagong Court Building, Rangpur Town Hall and Rajshahi College. The zamindar gentry built many palaces in the latter style, including the Ahsan Manzil, the Baliati Zamnidar Bari, the Tajhat Palace, the Rose Garden Palace, the Dighapatia Palace, the Puthia Rajbari, Natore Rajbari and the Mohera Zamindar Bari. Muzharul Islam is considered to be a pioneer of modernist movement in Bangladesh and South Asia.[332] Louis Kahn is a notable foreign architect who designed the National Parliament Building in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar.[333]

Embroidery on Nakshi kantha (embroidered quilt), a centuries-old Bengali art tradition

Aparajeyo Bangla, a sculpture dedicated to the Bangladesh Liberation War, located on the campus of the University of Dhaka
The recorded history of art in Bangladesh can be traced to the 3rd century BCE, when terracotta sculptures were made in the region.
